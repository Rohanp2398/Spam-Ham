# Spam-Ham
Spam/Ham classifier using Naive Bayes   algo using TFIDF

Project Overview
This project is a text classification task where we aim to categorize emails as either "Spam" or "Ham" (not spam) using a Naive Bayes algorithm. The text data is first transformed into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) before being passed to the classifier.

Dependencies
Before running the code, make sure to have the following libraries installed:

Python (version 3.6+)
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK (for text preprocessing)
